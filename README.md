## Lessons learned

- **Best Practices** for designing and building advanced, production-ready apps.
- Integrating **Typescript**, **React**, and **React-Redux** together.
- Designing highly **reusable React components**.
- Creating a **custom plugin for Esbuild** to enable in-browser transpiling/bundling with support for imports from npm.
- Creating a **caching layer** for imported modules/bundled code using **Local-Forage**.
- Using **Redux-Middlewares** for handling complex business logic.
- Taking advantage of powerful **third-party libraries** such as: **bulma**, **immer**, **monaco-editor**, **react-md-editor**, **commander**, etc...
- Safely **handling user input** by utilizing iframes as a code-execution environment- the same technique used by popular sites such as Codepen.
- Utilizing **Lerna** and **nx** to create a **mono-repo** with multiple packages and build targets.
- Creating a **Restful-API** to serve up a **Front-End** application from a **CLI**.
- Utilizing **web-assembly** to go...BLAZINGLY FAST!
- **Deploying** to **npm** and **Vercel**.

## Reflection

**Note**: A large portion of this project was built by following along with a [tutorial series](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-and-typescript-build-a-portfolio-project/) by Stephen Grider on Udemy. I extended and improved upon the original idea.

This was a great learning experience for me! I learned a ton about TypeScript, React, and React-Redux as well as some project-specific libraries such as Monaco-Editor and Resizable. An unexpected challenge I faced was working with Lerna and understanding the build process. This project contains multiple packages, and I had to learn how to configure Lerna to build and deploy the packages in the correct order and for different production environments.

I also learned a lot about the importance of planning and design when building a large-scale application. It's very clear to me how useful OOP principles can be in designing larger apps. Developing each component in a modular way and ensuring that the code is reusable makes it much easier to modify and add more features later on.

I had a lot of fun working on this project, and I'm excited to continue learning and improving my skills. ✅
