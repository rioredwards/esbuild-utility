## Features

- **All-in-One Sandbox**: Write, edit, and preview JavaScript and React code snippets without the need for external tools.
- **Real-Time Editing**: See the results of your code immediately with j-scribe's live preview feature, making it easier to debug and visualize your work.
- **Library Support**: Utilize popular libraries and frameworks to enhance your coding experience.
- **Text-Editor**: j-scribe provides a user-friendly way to document code using the built-in Markdown text-editor.
- **Sharing and Collaboration**: j-scribe projects are automatically serialized and saved to user's machines, making it possible to store and share projects with others.
- **Command-Line Interface**: j-scribe offers a convenient CLI, available on npm, for opening and creating j-scribe files from the command line. `j-scribe1 serve <filename>` starts a local API and opens the front-end application on a localhost port, allowing users to easily access and interact with j-scribe in their browser.

## Usage

1. Install the [CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/j-scribe1) by running `npm i j-scribe1`.
2. Open the built-in tutorial with `j-scribe1 serve _intro` and follow the instructions to get familiar with the basic features j-scribe offers.
3. Open new or existing notes with `j-scribe1 serve <filename>` (Optionally include a filepath: `j-scribe1 serve <path/filename>`).
4. Run `j-scribe1 --help` for additional help

## Lessons Learned

- **Best Practices** for designing and building advanced, **production-ready** apps.
- Integrating **Typescript**, **React** and **React-Redux** together.
- Designing highly **reusable React components**.
- Creating a **custom plugin** for **Esbuild** to enable in-browser transpiling/bundling with support for imports from npm.
- Creating a **caching layer** for imported modules/bundled code using Local-Forage.
- Using **Redux-Middlewares** for handling complex business logic.
- Taking advantage of powerful **third-party libraries** such as: bulma, immer, monaco-editor, react-md-editor, commander, etc...
- **Safely handling user-input** by utilizing iframes as a code-execution environment- the same technique used by popular sites such as Codepen.
- Utilizing lerna and nx to create a **mono-repo** with multiple packages and build targets.
- Creating a **Restful-API** to serve up a **Front-End application** from a **CLI**.
- Utilizing **web-assembly** to go... **BLAZINGLY FAST!**
- **Deploying** to npm and vercel.

## Reflection

This project was a great learning experience for me. I learned a ton about TypeScript, React, and React-Redux as well as some project-specific libraries such as Monaco-Editor and Resizable. An unexpected challenge I faced was working with lerna and understanding the build process. This project contains multiple packages, and I had to learn how to configure lerna to build and deploy the packages in the correct order and for different production environments.

I also learned a lot about the importance of planning and design when building a large-scale application. It's very clear to me how useful OOP principles can be in designing larger apps. Developing each component in a modular way and ensuring that the code is reusable makes it much easier to modify and add more features later on.

I had a lot of fun working on this project, and I'm excited to continue learning and improving my skills. âœ…
